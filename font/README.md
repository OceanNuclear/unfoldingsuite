This directory is used for generating word art used in the program welcome messages. It can be used on a unix console as follows:

```figlet -f kban.flf YOUR WORDS HERE```

Where -f kban.flf chooses the font kbha (saved in the same directory). Found on [xero](https://github.com/xero/figlet-fonts)'s github.

Alterntaively you can use [the online generator](http://www.network-science.de/ascii/)
