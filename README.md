##Installation instruction:

- At the directory above unfoldingsuite/, there should be a file setup.py. Change directory (cd) to that one.
- ```python3 setup.py install --user --force```
- To reinstall, always manually delete the entire old package (For Debian, this is ```cd ~/.local/lib/python3.x/site-packages/unfoldingsuite```)
